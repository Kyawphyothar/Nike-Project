              Nike Founders: Phil Knight & Bill Bowerman
            </h5>

          <div class="col-8">
            <p class="fs-5 text-start">
              Now a billionaire businessman, at the beginning of his career Phil Knight worked as a sports
              reporter and accountant.

              At university, he earned awards for his track performances as a middle-distance runner in the
              late1950s. His track-and-field coach was Bill Bowerman.
              Two years before launching Nike, Phil graduated with a master's degree in business
              administration from Stanford.

              Combining his love for running and his newly acquired business skills, Phil launched his shoe
              company called Blue Ribbon Sports with the objective of importing high-quality and low-cost
              running shoes from Japan into the American market.

              Seven years later, in 1971, the company had grown to fifty employees. The collaboration with the
              Japanese shoe supplier had ended and Phil chose a shoe factory in Mexico that had been endorsed
              by Adidas to manufacture his shoes.

              He also needed a new name for his first order of leather soccer shoes which he would sell as football
              shoes. Looking for the best name, he ran a poll of his employees and came up with a name himself,
              Dimension Six which was rejected by everyone for being “unspeakably bad”.

              The rest of the suggestions were not great also. Unfortunately, he didn't have the time to come up with
              new names as he was on a deadline from the factory, the advertising department and the U.S.
              Patent Office where he needed to file paperwork with for his new shoe.

              In the last minute, he received one more suggestion from Jeff Johnson, the company's first employee.
              He said this particular name came to him in a dream the night before: Nike. It was the name of the
              Greek winged goddess of victory, it was short and had a strong sound thanks to the K letter. It had all
              the attributes of a good brand name that sticks in the mind of customers. With only a few seconds to
              make his decision, Phil chose Nike and the rest is history.

              The company changed its name from Blue Ribbon Sport to Nike in 1978.
